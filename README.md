# STEPS PERFORMED:
* **Dataset Preparation**: The Cats and Dogs dataset was downloaded and successfully unzipped to obtain the required image samples for the classification task.
* **Data Preprocessing**: Essential libraries were imported to facilitate data manipulation and deep learning tasks.
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Exploratory Data Analysis was performed to gain insights into the dataset, understand class distributions, and identify potential challenges.
* **Data Split**: The dataset was split into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.
* **Data Augmentation**: Data augmentation techniques were employed to enhance the training dataset by applying various transformations, leading to increased diversity and improved model generalization.
* **Model Architecture**: A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model was designed, incorporating essential layers such as Maxpooling, Batch Normalization, and Dropout, to build an effective image classifier.
* **Model Training**: The CNN model was trained using the augmented training data to learn relevant features and optimize the classification task.
* **Model Evaluation**: The final model achieved promising results, demonstrating an accuracy of 0.9094 and a loss of 0.2201 on the training set and a validation accuracy of 0.9098 and a validation loss of 0.2097 on the validation set.
* **Real-World Testing**: The model was put to the test with real images, showcasing its ability to classify cats and dogs accurately.


*In conclusion, the "PixelAugment" project successfully utilized Keras and TensorFlow for image classification. By applying data augmentation techniques, the model demonstrated improved performance and robustness, achieving an impressive **accuracy of 90.94%** on the **training set** and **90.98%** on the **validation set**. These results indicate the effectiveness of the CNN architecture and data augmentation in building an accurate classifier for differentiating between cats and dogs. The project's success in classifying real-world images further reinforces the model's capability and practical applicability. Overall, "PixelAugment" presents a comprehensive and efficient approach to image classification using deep learning techniques.*
